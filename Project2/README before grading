I cant get my interactive element to work because I can not get my second floater (the milk) to be collectable, for some reason (literally ive spent 2 hours on it deleted everything and asked everyone and it wont work.)
Anyway with collecting the milk the player was suppose to be able to have superspeed for a time.
I will put the code for the speedboost here since i cant test if it works with the milk and i dont know if its right or wrong and i want my game to atleast be playable.

function Milk() {
playerXSpeed = 12;}
setTimeout(boostStop, 20);
}
